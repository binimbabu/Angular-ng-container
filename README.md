# NgContainer


<ng-container> is a logical container element in Angular that does not get rendered in the DOM. It's used to group structural directives (like *ngIf, *ngFor) without creating extra HTML elements.


Doesnâ€™t appear in the DOM (no actual HTML tag is rendered)

Useful for applying structural directives without adding unnecessary wrappers

Helps write cleaner, more efficient templates
